# ARTIC webshop

![Homepage](https://github.com/UNRULYEON/INFPRJ01C/blob/master/screenshots/client/png/artic-home.png?raw=true "Homepage")

This was a school project where we were tasked with building a functional webshop and accompanying admin panel.

A user has to be able to:

* Check out details of products
* Search for products
* Create an account
* Log in
* Save the cart for later use
* Add products to a wishlist
* Order products

As for the admin panel:

* Get insight into the current stock
* Add / alter / remove products
* Add / alter / remove users

Screenshots of the webshop can be found [here](https://github.com/UNRULYEON/INFPRJ01C/tree/master/screenshots/client/png) ([ZIP](https://github.com/UNRULYEON/INFPRJ01C/raw/master/screenshots/client/png/artic.zip)) and of the admin panel [here](https://github.com/UNRULYEON/INFPRJ01C/tree/master/screenshots/admin/png) ([ZIP](https://github.com/UNRULYEON/INFPRJ01C/raw/master/screenshots/admin/png/artic.zip))
